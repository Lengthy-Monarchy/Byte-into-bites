# Problem Statement for "Sarah's Bakery Online Ordering System"

# Title: "Byte into Bites: Crafting Convenience at Sarah's Bakery"

# The Nairobi Bakery Buzz:
At the heart of Nairobi, Sarah's Bakery has become the city's sweet sensation. The bakery's success story is delightful, but it comes with a challenge: long queues that test the patience of busy customers, especially office workers. To transform this issue into an opportunity, I propose a digital solution that not only serves Sarah's customers but also showcases the web development skills I've honed during this boot camp.

# The Core of Our Digital Bakery:
This project, titled "Byte into Bites," aims to digitize the bakery experience, making it convenient and enjoyable for Sarah's clientele. It's a demonstration of my expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and asynchronous programming, cooked to perfection.

# The Recipe for Our Single-Page App:

1. Assorted Baked Goods at a Click: The app will feature a list of assorted baked goods. Each item will have buttons to adjust the quantity, adding a practical and interactive element.
2. Dynamic Cart Display: A dynamic cart that pops down on the same page will show the full order details. This ensures a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.
3. Categorically Delicious: The bakery's offerings will be organized into categories. Upon selection, these categories will expand to reveal the available items, making the selection process both organized and enjoyable.
# How It Aligns with My Learning:
This project is a canvas for applying my skills in creating a responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web application. It encapsulates everything from handling asynchronous API requests to implementing interactive UI elements.

# Anticipated Challenges:

1. Intuitive UI/UX Design: Designing an interface that is both intuitive and capable of handling multiple interactions on a single page.
2. API Integration: Efficiently integrating and managing the API for real-time updates and order processing.
# In Summary:
"Byte into Bites" is more than a convenience tool for bakery enthusiasts; it's a testament to the skills I've developed and a step towards modernizing traditional businesses like Sarah's Bakery. This project is not just about coding; it's about baking digital solutions into Nairobi's flourishing culinary landscape.

## Notes
I scrapped the carrousel idea. It was a little too ambitious for my current skill-set
